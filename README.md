# Exploring Android's ecosystem hands-on, with purpose and structure

ðŸ“˜ A personal learning repository where I explore Kotlin and Android concepts by building **mini modular apps** â€” each focused on one concept like WorkManager, LiveData, Room, Retrofit, Coroutines, etc.

#Not just learning â€” internalizing Android by building real use cases

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repo is a collection of **feature-focused learning modules**. For each Android or Kotlin concept I learn, I build a **small, working app or module** with:

- Clean code using **production-ready patterns**
- **MVVM architecture**, ViewModel, LiveData
- **Retrofit**, **Room**, **Coroutines**, **WorkManager**, and more
- Simple and understandable UI
- Separation of concerns, modularity, and reusability

> I'm using this space to grow my Android expertise and apply each concept practically.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

| Concept        | Module / Feature Built                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| WorkManager    | News Fetch App running in background          |
| LiveData       | Live data updates from ViewModel to UI        |
| Retrofit       | API integration with clean architecture       |
| Room DB        | Local database with CRUD example              |
| Coroutines     | Background operations using suspend functions |
| ViewModel      | Lifecycle-aware architecture component        |

_(More modules will be added as I learn new concepts)_

# My Intent : 
âœ… Learn Kotlin with real Android use cases

âœ… Practice modular, clean coding patterns

âœ… Create reference code for interviews and future projects

âœ… Build confidence by learning through integration, not just theory
