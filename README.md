# KotlinAndroidLearningModules

ðŸ“˜ A personal learning repository where I explore Kotlin and Android concepts by building **mini modular apps** â€” each focused on one concept like WorkManager, LiveData, Room, Retrofit, Coroutines, etc.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repo is a collection of **feature-focused learning modules**. For each Android or Kotlin concept I learn, I build a **small, working app or module** with:

- Clean code using **production-ready patterns**
- **MVVM architecture**, ViewModel, LiveData
- **Retrofit**, **Room**, **Coroutines**, **WorkManager**, and more
- Simple and understandable UI
- Separation of concerns, modularity, and reusability

> I'm using this space to grow my Android expertise and apply each concept practically.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

| Concept        | Module / Feature Built                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| WorkManager    | News Fetch App running in background          |
| LiveData       | Live data updates from ViewModel to UI        |
| Retrofit       | API integration with clean architecture       |
| Room DB        | Local database with CRUD example              |
| Coroutines     | Background operations using suspend functions |
| ViewModel      | Lifecycle-aware architecture component        |

_(More modules will be added as I learn new concepts)_
